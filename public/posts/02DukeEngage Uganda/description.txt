I was selected to participate in DukeEngage Uganda - an international engineering volunteer program based in the country's captital of Kampala. 

I lived 24/7 in a house with 16 engineering students: eight from Makerere University, and eight from Duke. Over two months of living and working together in Kampala's dense urban center, I gained both a profound appreciation for the living and working cultures of Uganda and a working proficiency in Luganda, the predominant tribal language. I also became lifelong friends with my two Ugandan roommates, Edgar and James.

Every day brought something new; whether journeying to crowded wet markets, the coast of Lake Victoria, or the country's rainforest heartlands, I was awestruck by the country's vibrance and variety.

Standout memories include the 5-foot tall Marabou storks, the incredible fresh fruit, the resourceful and energetic street vendors, and, of course, the flocks of playful monkeys.
