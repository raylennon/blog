Part of the reason for making this site is to improve my web development skills. <a href="http://www.ray.red">Ray.red</a> is hosted on an AWS webserver, particularly running on a Elastic Beanstalk instance. The back-end is written in NodeJS, and the hosted code is automatically populated with changes to my <a href="https://github.com/raylennon/Personal">GitHub Repository</a>. I use NodeJS requests and dynamic EJS pages to populate the website with posts - including autogenerated layouts for desktop and mobile. I have a lot more plans for this site in the future, including interactive tech demos and more javascript experiments.

<i>Edit May 2024: I realized that running a dynamic backend was overkill (and pricey), so I transitioned to generating static sites via nodejs+wget and serving from GitHub Pages</i>
