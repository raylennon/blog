Duke IGNITE is a 2-day hackathon focused on learning and inclusivity. Teams are matched with an experienced student mentor to help teams scope, architect, and debug projects from start to finish.

As an IGNITE mentor, I was excited to host a Blender 3D modelling workshop this past weekend! I taught a group of fellow Duke students the capabilities of Blender, my favorite piece of open-source 3D software, as it pertains to creating low-poly models for game development and animation. We went over the fundamentals of geometry-based modelling, topology, sculpting, and material assignment.
