During a quiet moment of my makerspace TA office hours, an idea struck for a new project. I started tinkering with a Raspberry Pi, a mobile phone charger, and some scrounged parts, and wound up creating a robot!

The robot, known around Duke as "Ray's Dog", runs a python Flask server over campus wifi. It's equipped with a livestreaming camera, an LCD display for custom messages/ faces, and two bidirectional two motors.

He likes hanging out on the BC plaza, couriering messages to friends and weaving through tables and chairs. Thanks to his web-based UI, anyone on a campus network can control him via <a href="raysdog.wireless.duke.edu">raysdog.wireless.duke.edu</a> (if school's in session and he isn't taking a nap, that is).

Ray's Dog was invited to participate in Duke's <a href="https://colab.duke.edu/">Innovation Co-Lab</a> Makerfair 2023 - he made a ton of new friends, and got some great recommendations for new features!
