Throughout my Junior year, I've led an independent research project in the area of metal additively-manufactured lattice structures for bone implants!

As part of <a target="_blank" href="https://mems.duke.edu/faculty/ken-gall">Dr. Kenneth Gall's</a> group at Duke, I’ve been leading an independent research project improving design of titanium 3D-printed metamaterials for seamless orthopedic integration into bone tissue. I design, manufacture, test, and simulate gyroid structures made from Ti6Al4V and study how their varying geometry affects their structural properties. In collaboration with the medical school, I've used a combination of tensile, compressive, and torsional load frame analyses to fully characterize the gyroidal lattices as mechanical metamaterials. This experimental process is performed in parallel with an ongoing finite element study, which will offer additional insight into the structures' robustness against fatigue.

These structures are designed to "osiointegrate" - meaning that the surrounding bone is able to grown into them. I'm aiming to publish a paper with my findings in the fall: stay tuned!
