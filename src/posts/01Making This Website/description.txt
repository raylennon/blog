Updated July 2024: Part of the reason for making this site is to improve my web development skills. <a href="http://www.ray.red" style="color: rgb(256, 138, 138);">Ray.red</a> was originally hosted on an AWS webserver with a Elastic Beanstalk instance, with a code pipeline that populated an S3 bucket with updates to my <a href="https://github.com/raylennon/blog">Github repo</a>. Nowadays, I've realized that a dynamic site is totally overkill (until someday I decide to add a login page and microtransactions). The site is still written with a NodeJS backend, but within in a Vite environment which simplifies my development/build process. As for frontend, I populate the site with images & blog posts using <a href="https://ejs.co/">EJS</a> templates and <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> for styling & components. The /docs folder of the repository is hosted statically using <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github pages</a>.
