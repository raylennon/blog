It's official - I'm heading to Cambridge this fall to embark on a Mechanical Engineering PhD at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. I'll be working in Prof. John Hart's Mechanosynthesis Group, studying & performing research at the cutting edge of additive manufacturing and architected materials.
