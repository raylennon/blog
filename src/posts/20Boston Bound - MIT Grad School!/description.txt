It's official - I'm heading to Cambridge this fall to embark on a Mechanical Engineering PhD at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. I'll be working in Prof. John Hart's <a href="https://mechanosynthesis.mit.edu/">Mechanosynthesis Group</a>, studying & performing research that studies new ways of tailoring materials' surface characteristics using additive menufacturing and architected structures. Stay tuned for more details about my research there!
