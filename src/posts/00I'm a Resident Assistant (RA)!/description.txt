In my senior year, I'm an RA in Duke's Craven Quad - home to almost 400 residents! In August, I moved in early to participate in two weeks of training covering community building, residential leadership, and safety procedures. My favorite part was our kick-off rally welcoming 1500+ freshmen - the Class of 2027 - inside the legendary Cameron Indoor Stadium, where they joined their new 'houses' as part of Duke's new QuadEx residential living and learning model. 

Halfway through the first semester, things are going great; I've hosted community events and faculty dinners, and I've loved getting to know the 25 students in my section.
