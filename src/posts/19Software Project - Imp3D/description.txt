I've got a new coding project brewing! My joint interest in math (esp. geometry), design, and computer graphics have led me down many wikipedia rabbitholes related to implicit field-driven representations of solid volumes. Via signed distance functions, it's possible to represent nearly any surface, even of infinite complexity, using closed-form functional expressions - a solution that solves many of the issues with polygonal surface representations, but introduces a host of new and exciting mathematical challenges. I'm interested in the engineering & aesthethic implications of this area, and so I've started work on <a href="imp-3D.com/">Imp 3D</a> (short for 'implicit'), an online design space for exploring implicit surfaces. Hopefully, more documentation and examples to come soon!
