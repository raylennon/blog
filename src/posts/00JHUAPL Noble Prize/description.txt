I'm honored to have been awarded APL’s 2022 Noble Prize for “courageous pursuit of bold discovery” - one of 23 Annual Achievement Awards granted across the 8,500-person research organization.

The award recognizes my team's work on the project MAINER (Manipulating Atmospheric Ice Nucleation Events, Redux), which targets the development of novel bio-derived cloud seeding applications. My role on the project involved performing data aggregation and analysis from satellite imagery, to uncover global patterns in high-atmospheric cloud formation. 

I led the team’s cloud data analysis by accessing data from a variety of earth-observing satellites. I accomplished this via NASA's Earth Observing System Data and Information System (<a href="https://worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov/?v=-149.69377281021897,-46.546875,36.350022810218974,53.015625&t=2023-06-17-T18%3A37%3A40Z">EOSDIS</a>) - a powerful tool for for managing NASA Earth science data from various sources (e.g. satellites, aircraft, field measurements, other programs) in one place. I used python libraries such as <a href="https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/">Cartopy</a> for cartopgraphic projections, <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/">BeautifulSoup</a> for web scraping, <a href="https://matplotlib.org/">Matplotlib</a> for visualization, and <a href="https://scipy.org/">SciPy</a> for regression, interpolation, and prediction.
