I'm excited to say that my first public, peer-reviewed publication is out! A CDC-sponsored project that I collaborated on during summer 2022 just got through the public release process and was published in the APL Technical Digest:

<i>Computational Fluid Dynamics for Public Health and Safety, Darragh R., Campbell V., Winstead P., Lennon R., Stiles C., JHU APL Technical Digest (ISSN 0270-5214)</i>

Throughout the project, I created interactive applications to explore data from airflow simulations of surgical environments. Currently, the CDC is applying my team's results to make operating rooms safer and contaminant-free by optimizing the configuration of vents and objects in these rooms to divert particle flows away from medical staff.
