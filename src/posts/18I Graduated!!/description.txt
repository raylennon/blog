On May 12th I graduated magna cum laude from Duke University, with a BSE in Mechanical Engineering and a minor in computer science. In addition to graduating with departmental distinction for my undergraduate research, I was honored to receive the <a href="https://mems.duke.edu/undergrad/students/awards-honors">Raymond C. Gaugler Award in Materials Science & Engineering</a>, for academic excellence in Materials Science. Now I'm on to the next chapter in Boston. Stay tuned!!
