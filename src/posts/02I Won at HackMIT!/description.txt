HackMIT 2022 was a blast. I flew to Boston and almost immediately got to work brainstorming project ideas with my three-person team (myself, and two CMU computer science students). Our team connected over a shared love at the intersection of design and tech, and we landed on an idea to create an open-ended video game loosely inspired by Shel Silverstein's 'The Giving Tree' â€“ we called our game Roots.

The game's premise is simple: as a tree, decide whether to grow roots or branches as the forest environment around you symbiotically responds and adapts. To survive storms, your tree must have a strong root structure, yet growing branches is how you make a habitat for your fellow forest friends.

I concentrated on designing and building our 3d assets in <a href="https://blender.org/">Blender</a>, and my teammates architected the game mechanics in <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a>. For our game's unique concept and visual style, as well as its themes of connectness and selflessness, our team was the sole winner of the Meta Metaverse Challenge, and each of us was awarded a pair of <a href="https://www.ray-ban.com/usa/electronics/RW4002ray-ban%20stories%20%7C%20wayfarer-black/8056597705110">RayBans Stories</a>.
