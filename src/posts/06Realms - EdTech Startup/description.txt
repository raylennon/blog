I started an education technology company called Realms with two Duke MBA students, and incubated it under Duke Innovation & Entrepreneurship. The goal of Realms is to make Zoom classrooms more engaging: the app collects live comprehension feedback from students and uses it to identify challenge areas and offer at-a-glance course feedback for professors. 

Continuing my project from HackDuke 2021, I led development on front and back-end systems for the app, including an interactive HTML interface and cloud-hosted database. Throughout the development process I learned how to set up a massively scalable <a target="_blank" href="https://nodejs.org/en">NodeJS</a> server on AWS, how to integrate database structures with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a>, and how to integrate the entire platform as an <a target="_blank" href="https://developers.zoom.us/docs/integrations/">OAuth Zoom app</a>.

During development of a functioning prototype, Realms was pitched to several universities - including UNC, Duke, and NC State - drawing widespread interest and feedback.
