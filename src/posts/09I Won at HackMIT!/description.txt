HackMIT 2022 was a blast. I flew to Boston and almost immediately got to work brainstorming project ideas with my three-person team (myself, and two CMU computer science students). Our team connected over a shared love at the intersection of design and tech, and we landed on an idea to create an open-ended video game loosely inspired by Shel Silverstein's 'The Giving Tree' – we called our game Roots.

The game's premise is simple: as a tree, decide whether to grow roots or branches as the forest environment around you symbiotically responds and adapts. To survive storms, your tree must have a strong root structure, yet growing branches is how you make a habitat for your fellow forest friends.
